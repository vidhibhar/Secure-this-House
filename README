This program is a security system that lets people into a house. 
My code has a owner of the house, who is the only one allowed to 
change keys, while they are in the house. Another exception is 
that anyone with the firefighter key can get into the house.

In order to get into the house you must follow the excat order:
insert key, turn key, and enter house. 

My code starts off with a while loop that is true. Inside it checks
if the user input matches with any of the commands and performs the 
appropriate tasks with them. As people are entering the house, a
list is storing the keys and people inside the house. 

With the command "whos inside" the code will print the list of people 
inside the house. With the command "change locks" the owner can change 
the keys. With the command "leave house", the user inside leaves. 
Anything else results in error.
